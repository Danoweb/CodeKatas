# Grid Pathfinding Codekata By Dan Reed

The objective is to find the path of lowest cost when moving across a grid. For this
challenge, you are provided a grid of integers where each integer represents the
amount of cost encountered at a given point on the grid. A path enters the grid from
the left (at any point) and passes through the grid to the right, moving only one
column per round. Movement is always to an adjacent column, meaning the path
can proceed horizontally or diagonally. For the sake of this challenge, we assume the
first and last row are also adjacent. Effectively, the grid “wraps”.
